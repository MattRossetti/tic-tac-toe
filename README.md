## Project Overview
This Project is part of The Odin Project's Full stack JavaScript course. I created a simple tic-tac-toe game in a broswer. The player can choose to either play against another person, or play against an AI. The page also tracks how many wins each player has.

## Lessons Learned
The goal of this project was to become familiar with modules, objects, and factory functions in Javascript. This was a new way of thinking for me, but ultimately I see the benefit. Each player is created with a factory function has all the important information stored within the object, and can only be accessed by calling functions contained within that object. This is ultimately a better way to organize code and I will continue to use it in the future!

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Potential Improvements
1. Currently the AI, just picks a square by random and places its move there, this could be improved in the future by using an algorithm to pick the best possible move and place its mark there.
2. The animation for making a move is not ideal, It can be improved in the future but the way the game board is built has to be rebuilt to allow for a better fade in.
